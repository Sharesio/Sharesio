# Sharesio
Project developed for *Intelligent System Project* course conducted at *Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya*.

### Development
In the `scripts/` directory you can find following scripts:
* `clean.sh` - removes directories generated when starting Flask application,
* `flask.sh` - launches Flask server,
* `install.sh` - installs project python requirements,
* `ngrok.sh` - generates a publicly available url and routes the traffic to local Flask server using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). After restarting ngrok it's necessary to go to [App settings](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/2679258505457967/messenger/settings/) and provide new url together with *verification token*.

Messenger bot requires 2 tokens in order to obtain a secure communication with Messenger API:
* *verification token* - random string generated locally,
* *page access tokens* - token generated by facebook and assigned to Sharesio app in *facebook for developers* app. 

They should be stored in a file `resources/secrets.json` with the following format:
```json
{
  "verification_token": "exampletoken",
  "page_access_token": "exampletoken"
}
```
